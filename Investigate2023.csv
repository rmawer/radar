Pipelines for infrastructure as code,Adopt,Techniques,FALSE,"The use of pipelines for infrastructure as code lets you find errors before changes are applied to operational environments — including environments used for development and testing. They also offer a way to ensure that infrastructure tooling is run consistently, using CI/CD agents rather than individual workstations."
Terraform,Adopt,Tools,FALSE,"Terraform, is rapidly becoming a de facto choice for creating and managing cloud infrastructures by writing declarative definitions."
Chaos Engineering,Assess,Techniques,FALSE,Chaos engineering is the discipline of experimenting on a software system in production in order to build confidence in the system's capability to withstand turbulent and unexpected conditions.
Zero-Trust Architecture,Adopt,Techniques,FALSE,ZTA is a paradigm shift in security architecture and strategy. Its based on the assumption that a network perimeter is no longer representative of a secure boundary and no implicit trust should be granted to users or services based solely on their physical or network location. 
Kubernetes,Adopt,Platforms,FALSE,Kubernetes has become the container orchestration platform of choice for major public cloud platforms.
Pulumi,Assess,Platforms,FALSE,"Pulumi distinguishes itself by allowing configurations (for Infrastructure as Code) to be written in TypeScript/JavaScript, Python and Go — no markup language or templating required. Pulumi is tightly focused on cloud-native architectures — including containers, serverless functions and data services — and provides good support for Kubernetes. "
Observability as code,Assess,Techniques,FALSE,"Traditionally, configuration of monitoring dashboards and setting up alerts is done through GUI-based point-and-click systems. This approach leads to nonrepeatable dashboard configurations, no ability to continuously test and adjust alerts to avoid alert fatigue or missing out on important alerts, and drift from organizational best practices."
The three Rs of security,Trial,Techniques,FALSE,"The three Rs of enterprise security — rotate, repair and repave — take advantage of infrastructure automation and continuous delivery to eliminate opportunities for attack. Rotating credentials, applying patches as soon as they're available and rebuilding systems from a known, secure state — all within a matter of minutes or hours — makes it harder for attackers to succeed."
"""Handcranking"" of Hadoop clusters using config management tools",Hold,Techniques,FALSE,"""Handcranking"" of Hadoop clusters happens when using config management tools such as Ansible, Chef and others. Although these tools are great at provisioning immutable infrastructure components, they're not very useful when you have to manage stateful systems and can often lead to significant effort trying to manage and evolve clusters using these tools."

Separate DevOps team,Hold,Techniques,FALSE,"We recommend embedding operations skills into delivery teams to reduce friction and deliver better outcomes. However where there is a need for significant investment in tooling and automation, we do see a role for a Delivery Engineering team.  Rather than being a helpdesk, these teams build tooling and enable teams to deploy, monitor, and maintain their own production environments.  "
